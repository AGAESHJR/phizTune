# Introduction
Our project, phizTune, aims to revolutionize the music streaming experience
 by leveraging computer vision and machine learning. Using facial emotion
 recognition in real-time, our web application generates personalized playlists
 based on users' emotional states. By accurately identifying emotions,
 phizTune provides effective tools for managing emotional stress, offering
 tailored song recommendations that match users' moods. Through
 continuous machine learning, the application improves recognition accuracy
 and refines recommendations over time. Our ultimate goal is to enhance
 mental well-being by empowering users to discover new music and make
 positive changes in their lives based on the relationship between mood and
 behavior. phizTune strives to deliver a more personalized and enjoyable
 musical experience, contributing to an overall higher quality of life
